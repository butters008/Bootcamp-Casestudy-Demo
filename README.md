(4/5/21)
We got the search function working so we can pull up any user from the DB
and got a little error checking in.  Also got some error messages ready in
the RegisterFormBean class

This project is meant to be practice for concepts and knowledge of Springboot.  This repo was started a few days after the creation of the project
to help people understand how to push to Github and now it is a precursor for the capstone project for this bootcamp.

As of right now we have successfull done Create, Update, and now Read.
