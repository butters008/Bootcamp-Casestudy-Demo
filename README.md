Here are some of the cool things that we had done today in class for the bootcamp. The first thing that we did was error
checking and showing errors on the register.jsp page. We had it previously send errors to the IDE console, but now we
have it printing onto the page itself. To complete this, we did binding request inside the controller and inside the jsp
page, we printed out through a forEach loop underneath each input line. The next thing, was the 500 error handing, we
created and error handling controller that would catch and correctly filter out what 500 error we were looking at and
print it out onto the 500.jsp page. The 404 is not quite implemented but it will be ether tomorrow morning or evening
after some work on the real capstone. This would just a straight copy and paste from Eric's demo since this was a
pre-generated vector image for 404 on the 404.jsp

We got the search function working so we can pull up any user from the DB and got a little error checking in. Also got
some error messages ready in the RegisterFormBean class

This project is meant to be practice for concepts and knowledge of Springboot. This repo was started a few days after
the creation of the project to help people understand how to push to GitHub, and now it is a precursor for the capstone
project for this bootcamp.

As of right now we have successful done Create, Update, and now Read.
